## Migration Guide

For existing code, follow these steps:

1. **Replace fetch with API service** (1-2 days)
   ```javascript
   // Before
   const response = await fetch('/api/data');
   
   // After
   import api from '@modules/api-service';
   const data = await api.get('/api/data');
   ```

2. **Add performance monitoring** (1 day)
   ```javascript
   import monitor from '@modules/performance-monitor';
   monitor.startMark('operation');
   // ... operation
   monitor.endMark('operation');
   ```

3. **Optimize event handlers** (1-2 days)
   ```javascript
   import { debounce } from '@utils';
   input.addEventListener('input', debounce(handler, 300));
   ```

4. **Configure resource hints** (1 day)
   ```javascript
   import hints from '@modules/resource-hints';
   hints.addPreconnect('https://api.example.com');
   ```

5. **Add feature flags** (1 day)
   ```javascript
   import config from '@modules/app-config';
   if (config.isFeatureEnabled('newFeature')) {
     // ...
   }
   ```

## Testing

All new modules include example tests. Run with:

```bash
npm test
```

Test coverage goals:
- Utilities: 90%+ coverage
